# Muslimtify

Muslimtify keeps you consistent with your daily prayers by delivering accurate prayer times and timely desktop notifications. Designed for Linux and Windows, it automatically calculates prayer schedules and reminds you 30, 15, and 5 minutes before the Adhan, or at your own custom intervals, and when it's time to pray. Every prayer time is calculated locally on your machine, with no accounts and no tracking. The only thing that touches the network is location detection via `ipinfo.io`, and even that is optional: set your coordinates manually, or read them from a GPS receiver with `location gps on`, and Muslimtify makes no network request at all.

Muslimtify supports **21 international calculation methods** including MWL, ISNA, Umm al-Qura (Makkah), Egyptian General Authority, Kemenag (Indonesia), JAKIM (Malaysia), Diyanet (Turkey), and more. The default method is Kemenag. With persistent configuration and minimal setup, Muslimtify integrates seamlessly into your daily routine without interrupting your workflow.

> [!Note]
> Prayer time calculations are powered by [libmuslim](https://github.com/muslimtify-org/libmuslim), a portable library extracted from this project to enable a more flexible and reusable ecosystem for Muslim developers.

> ## Roadmap
> - ~Merge command  `location auto` and `method auto` into (only) `config auto` and optimize auto detection per (249) country~
> - ~Refactor from timer-driven into a portable long-running loop~
> - ~Add custom adzan sound notifications~
> - ~Re-design command-line (BREAKING CHANGES)~
> - ~Add read lat/long from user GPS~
> - Add GUI (see branch gui to see a progress)
> - Distribute to Flatpak
> - MacOS support (if devices is available)
> - Wearable Device support
> - Embedded Device Support

> [!Important]
> This project is available for Linux and Windows users, but not yet for Mac users because we need a Mac device to make Muslimtify run on macOS. We are looking for brothers and sisters who have a Mac and experience in low-level C programming to contribute to the project and help bring Muslimtify to macOS. Alternatively, you can support us via GitHub Sponsors in the sponsor section.

## Installation

### Prebuilt Binaries (GitHub Releases)

Every release ships ready-to-run binaries for Linux and Windows on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/muslimtify-org/muslimtify/releases/latest).

**Linux** (`x86_64` or `aarch64`): the binaries are dynamically linked, so
install the runtime libraries first, then extract and install:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libnotify4 libcurl4
# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install libnotify libcurl
# Arch
sudo pacman -S libnotify curl

tar xzf muslimtify-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz
sudo cp -r muslimtify-<version>-linux-<arch>/{bin,lib,share} /usr/local/
muslimtify daemon install
```

**Windows** (`x64` or `arm64`): download and run the matching installer:

```
muslimtify-<version>-setup-x64.exe      # Intel/AMD
muslimtify-<version>-setup-arm64.exe    # ARM
```

Verify any download against the published checksums:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S muslimtify
```

### Fedora (COPR)

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable rizukirr/muslimtify
sudo dnf install muslimtify
```

### Debian/Ubuntu (PPA)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rizukirr/muslimtify
sudo apt update
sudo apt install muslimtify
```

### Linux Source Install

Install dependencies:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake pkg-config libnotify-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install git gcc cmake pkgconfig libnotify-devel libcurl-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S git base-devel cmake pkgconfig libnotify curl
```

GPS is optional and needs nothing at build time. Install `gpsd` only if you want
Muslimtify to read coordinates from a local receiver:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gpsd
# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gpsd
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gpsd
```

Clone, install, and enable background checks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muslimtify-org/muslimtify.git
cd muslimtify
sudo ./install.sh
muslimtify daemon install
```

`install.sh` compiles as the user who invoked `sudo` rather than as root, and
refuses to build from a source tree that is group- or world-writable, since
anything planted there would otherwise run with root privileges. If it reports
unsafe permissions, fix the listed paths so each is owned by root or by you and
is not writable by others, then re-run.

### Windows (winget)

```powershell
winget install muslimtify
```

### Windows Source Install

Building on Windows requires MSVC. The build stops with an explicit message if
another compiler is used.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/muslimtify-org/muslimtify.git
cd muslimtify
.\install.ps1
muslimtify daemon install
```

To remove the Windows install later, run `.\uninstall.ps1`.

If you prefer building manually first:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
cmake --install build --config Release
muslimtify daemon install
```

## Post Installation
Run `muslimtify daemon status` to check if Muslimtify is registered with systemd. If no status is found, run `muslimtify daemon install` to register the service and ensure it runs as expected.

Muslimtify automatically selects the standard prayer time calculation method based on your country and location. Run `muslimtify` to verify that your configuration is correct. If the automatic selection does not meet your needs, you can set it manually using `muslimtify method <key-method>`. A full list of available methods is documented [here](#calculation-methods).

## Configuration

Muslimtify can be configured with CLI commands or by editing `config.json`
manually.

Config paths:
- Linux config: `~/.config/muslimtify/config.json`
- Linux cache: `~/.cache/muslimtify`
- Windows config: `%APPDATA%\muslimtify\config.json`
- Windows cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\muslimtify`

Common setup commands:

```bash
muslimtify location set --auto                  # detect location from IP
muslimtify location set --auto --city=Mansoura  # auto-detect but use your own city label
muslimtify method --auto                        # select method from the detected country
muslimtify location set --lat=-6.175 --long=106.82  # set location manually (uses system timezone)
muslimtify location set --timezone=Asia/Jakarta     # override timezone
muslimtify location set --city=Jakarta              # add a city label
muslimtify location set --refresh-interval=21600    # re-check location every 6h (0=off, min 3600)
muslimtify location gps on        # read coordinates from a local GPS receiver
muslimtify location gps off       # go back to ipinfo network geolocation
muslimtify location gps           # show whether GPS is enabled
muslimtify method --list          # list all available calculation methods
muslimtify method mwl             # set calculation method
muslimtify madzhab hanafi         # set madzhab (shafi/hanafi)
muslimtify notification --reminder --all 30 15 5    # set every prayer's reminders (minutes before adhan)
muslimtify notification --reminder fajr 30 15 5     # set reminders for a single prayer
muslimtify notification           # show current notification settings
muslimtify location               # show current location
```

GPS is off by default and maps to a single `use_gps` key in the `location` block
of `config.json`. On Linux the coordinates come from a running `gpsd`, read over
a local socket on `127.0.0.1:2947`, with no `libgps` build dependency. On Windows
they come from the WinRT Geolocator, which needs location access enabled in
Settings. `location gps on` probes the receiver first and refuses to enable if
none is reachable, so a missing daemon fails immediately rather than degrading
silently later. Whenever GPS has no fix, `ipinfo.io` is used instead. GPS
supplies coordinates only, so the timezone is still taken from the host system.

The timezone itself is validated when you set it. A name the system cannot
resolve is rejected outright rather than saved and silently treated as UTC, and
the offset used to compute prayer times is derived from the IANA name for the
date being calculated, so daylight saving is handled automatically.

Resetting the configuration is done by deleting `config.json`. Muslimtify falls
back to built-in defaults when the file is missing, and rewrites it the next
time you change a setting. Validation runs automatically every time the config
is loaded.

### Calculation Methods

Muslimtify supports the following calculation methods:

| Key | Method | Region |
|-----|--------|--------|
| `mwl` | Muslim World League | Europe, Far East |
| `makkah` | Umm al-Qura, Makkah | Arabian Peninsula |
| `isna` | ISNA | North America |
| `egypt` | Egyptian General Authority | Africa, Middle East |
| `karachi` | Univ. Islamic Sciences, Karachi | Pakistan, India, Bangladesh |
| `turkey` | Diyanet, Turkey | Turkey |
| `singapore` | MUIS, Singapore | Singapore |
| `jakim` | JAKIM, Malaysia | Malaysia |
| `kemenag` | KEMENAG, Indonesia | Indonesia (default) |
| `france` | UOIF, France | France |
| `russia` | Spiritual Admin., Russia | Russia |
| `dubai` | GAIAE, Dubai | UAE |
| `qatar` | Min. of Awqaf, Qatar | Qatar |
| `kuwait` | Min. of Awqaf, Kuwait | Kuwait |
| `jordan` | Min. of Awqaf, Jordan | Jordan |
| `gulf` | Gulf Region | Gulf states |
| `tunisia` | Min. of Religious Affairs | Tunisia |

| `morocco` | Min. of Habous, Morocco | Morocco |
| `portugal` | Comunidade Islamica de Lisboa | Portugal |
| `moonsighting` | Moonsighting Committee | Worldwide |

You can also use a custom method by setting `"method": "custom"` in `config.json` with your own `fajr_angle` and `isha_angle` values.

Manual JSON editing is useful when you want precise control over enabled
prayers, reminder offsets, notification settings, or location data.

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications are not appearing

- Run `muslimtify daemon status` to confirm the background service is running.
- On Linux, verify desktop notifications work with `notify-send "Test" "Hello"`.
- On Windows, local system settings can block toast delivery. Check
  notification settings, Focus Assist / Do Not Disturb, and whether the command
  is running in an interactive desktop session.

### Location detection is not working

- Run `muslimtify location set --auto` again.
- Set coordinates manually with `muslimtify location set --lat=<latitude> --long=<longitude>`.
  If the host machine is in a different region than the coordinates, override
  the timezone with `--timezone=<iana>`, e.g.
  `muslimtify location set --lat=-6.21 --long=106.84 --timezone=Asia/Jakarta`.
- Check network access to `ipinfo.io` if auto detection keeps failing.

### GPS will not turn on

`muslimtify location gps on` probes the receiver before saving, so it refuses
rather than enabling something that cannot work. The message names the missing
piece:

- `cannot reach gpsd`: install and start `gpsd`. Muslimtify reads it over a local
  socket on `127.0.0.1:2947`.
- `no GPS device detected`: `gpsd` is running but sees no hardware. Connect the
  receiver and confirm `gpsd` picked it up.
- `location access is turned off`: on Windows, enable Settings > Privacy &
  security > Location, then try again.

Being told GPS is enabled with no fix yet is not an error. The setting is saved
and `ipinfo.io` is used until the receiver locks on. If the daemon or device
later disappears, Muslimtify warns once and turns GPS off so it stops retrying
on every cycle. A denied permission does not turn it off, because granting
access in Settings is enough for the next attempt to succeed.

### Muslimtify rejects my timezone

The name must resolve on this system, so check the spelling against the IANA
database, for example `Asia/Jakarta` or `Europe/London`. Zones that legitimately
sit at UTC+0, such as `Africa/Abidjan`, are accepted.

### Prayer times are off by an hour

This is almost always daylight saving, which is handled automatically only when
a valid IANA zone is saved. Run `muslimtify location` and check the `timezone`
field. The `gmt` field shows the offset in effect today rather than the one
recorded when you last set your location. If the zone is wrong or empty, set it
with `muslimtify location set --timezone=<iana>`.

### A notification did not fire while the machine was asleep

Triggers missed within the previous 15 minutes still fire when the daemon
catches up. Anything older is dropped without firing, so resuming from a long
suspend does not replay a stack of stale Adhans.
